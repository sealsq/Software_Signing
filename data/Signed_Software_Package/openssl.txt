#Below are two steps to use OpenSSL to validate the signature.
#Step 1: Export the public key from the signing certificate file.
openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -pubkey -noout -out certificate.pub.pem

#Step 2: Validate the signature.
openssl dgst -sha256 -verify certificate.pub.pem -signature TestAppRaspberry_1.signature TestAppRaspberry_1.bin
